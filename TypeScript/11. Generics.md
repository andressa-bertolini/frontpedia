## Generics

Generic accepts any type. Once TypeScript recognizes the type entered, it keeps that type for the rest of the function

```
function firstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[0];
}
```

any vs T (Generics)

any means:
"It could be anything â€” and I, TypeScript, won't check anything!"

When you use any, TypeScript gives up on helping you.
It no longer guarantees that you are returning or manipulating the correct type.
