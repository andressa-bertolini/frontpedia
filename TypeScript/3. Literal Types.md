## Literal types

Literal types allow you to restrict the value of a variable to one or more exact values.

For example, instead of accepting any string, you can say that the variable can only be "light" or "dark":

```
type Theme = "light" | "dark";

let currentTheme: Theme;

currentTheme = "light";  // ✅ ok
currentTheme = "dark"; // ✅ ok
currentTheme = "blue";   // ❌ error
```
