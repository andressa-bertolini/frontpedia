## Utility types

Utility types are ready-made types that TypeScript provides to make it easier to manipulate types that you have already created

- Partial<Type> Makes all fields optional
- Required<Type> Makes all fields required
- Readonly<Type> Makes all fields read-only (cannot be changed)
- Pick<Type, Keys> Gets only some properties
- Omit<Type, Keys> Takes away (omits) some properties
- Record<Keys, Type> Creates an object with defined keys and types
- Exclude<UnionType, ExcludedMembers> Removes types from a union
- Extract<Type, Union> Gets compatible types from a union
- NonNullable<Type> Removes null and undefined from a type

### Partial
```
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserPartial = Partial<User>;
// equals to:
// { id?: number; name?: string; email?: string; }
```

### Pick
```
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserPick = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;
```
