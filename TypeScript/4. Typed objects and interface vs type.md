## Typed objects and interface vs type

```
const user: {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
} = {
  username: "peter",
  email: "peter@email.com",
  isAdmin: false,
};
```

***type***
Use type when:
- You need union, intersection, or complex composition.
- You are going to type things other than objects (e.g. primitives, tuples).
- You want more freedom and clarity in composite types.

```
type User = {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
};

const user: User = {
  username: "peter",
  email: "peter@email.com",
  isAdmin: false,
};
```

***interface***
Use interface when:
- You are modeling objects, especially public contracts (e.g. component props).
- You are going to extend or join with other types.
- You want to take advantage of reopening (such as in third-party libs or contexts).

```
interface User {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
};

const user: User = {
  username: "peter",
  email: "peter@email.com",
  isAdmin: false,
};
```
