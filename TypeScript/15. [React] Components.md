## Components

Manual typing (without React.FC)
```
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

type Props = {
  name: string;
  children?: ReactNode;
};

const Welcome = ({ name, children }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome, {name}!</p>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```
- Full control over what goes in the props
- More explicit: you decide when to include children
- The current recommended way in modern TypeScript projects

React.FC is a generic type provided by React that already includes a few things automatically:

- Prop typing
- Automatic inclusion of children?: ReactNode
- Returning the component as JSX.Element

```
import React from 'react';

type Props = {
  name: string;
};

const Welcome: React.FC<Props> = ({ name, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome, {name}!</p>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```
> [!NOTE]
> No longer officially recommended by the React team (but still widely used)

## Typing Children
In React, children are any content passed between your component's tags:

```
<My Component>
  <p>Hello!</p>
</My Component>
```

Typing:
```
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

type Props = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

const MeuComponente = ({ children }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};
```

Other possible types:

- ReactNode → Almost always. Accepts any renderable content
- ReactElement → When expecting only one React element
- JSX.Element → Return type of a component
- ReactChild → A single child (string, number, JSX.Element)
- ReactNode[] → A list of children
